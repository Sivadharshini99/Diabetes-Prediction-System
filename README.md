Features
- User-friendly Interface: Intuitive web interface for users to input their health data and receive predictions.
- Data Preprocessing:Cleansing and preprocessing of input data to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementation of multiple algorithms including Adaboost, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Voting Classifier for accurate predictions.
- Visualization: Visual representation of data and analysis results for better understanding.
- Deployment: Integration with Django for web-based deployment and access.

Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Backend: Python, Django
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas
- Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for production)

7. 
Anaconda Command Prompt is a command-line interface provided by Anaconda Navigator, which allows users to manage environments, packages, and execute Python scripts. Here's how you can use Anaconda Command Prompt:

 1. Open Anaconda Command Prompt:

- On Windows:
  - Search for "Anaconda Command Prompt" in the Start menu.
  - Click on it to open.

 2. Activate Anaconda Environment:

- If you have created a specific environment, activate it using the following command:
  ```
  conda activate <environment_name>
  ```
  Replace `<environment_name>` with the name of your environment.

- If you're using the base environment, it's not necessary to activate it.

 3. Install Packages:

- To install packages, you can use `conda` or `pip`:
  - Using conda:
    ```
    conda install <package_name>
    ```
  - Using pip:
    ```
    pip install <package_name>
    ```

 4. Update Packages:

- To update packages, use:
  ```
  conda update --all
  ```

 5. Create Anaconda Environment:

- To create a new environment, use:
  ```
  conda create --name <environment_name>
  ```

 6. Deactivate Anaconda Environment:

- To deactivate the current environment, use:
  ```
  conda deactivate
  ```

 7. Check Installed Packages:

- To see a list of installed packages in the current environment, use:
  ```
  conda list
  ```

 8. Run Python Scripts:

- You can execute Python scripts directly from the command prompt:
  ```
  python <script_name.py>
  ```

### 9. Open Jupyter Notebook:

- To open Jupyter Notebook, simply type:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```

 10. Miscellaneous Commands:

- There are several other commands you can use in Anaconda Command Prompt, such as managing environments, exporting environments, removing packages, etc. You can find more details in the Anaconda documentation or by using the `--help` option with specific commands.

Anaconda Command Prompt provides a convenient way to manage Python environments and packages, especially when working with data science and machine learning projects.

Module Description
1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial to ensure consistency and accuracy in predictions. This involves handling missing values and converting categorical data into a machine-readable format.

Preprocessing Techniques:
Dropna: Removes rows or columns with null values.
Drop Duplicate: Eliminates duplicate rows.
Label Encoder: Converts categorical labels into numeric form.

2. Data Analysis and Visualization
Data visualization plays a significant role in understanding patterns and relationships within the data.

3. Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation
The system implements four machine learning algorithms: Adaboost, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Voting Classifier.

Algorithm Implementations:
1.Adaboost Algorithm: Boosts the performance of other machine learning algorithms by focusing more on difficult cases.
2.Random Forest Classifier Algorithm: Ensemble learning algorithm for classification and regression problems.
3.Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier Algorithm: A feed-forward neural network with multiple layers for approximation and solving non-linear problems.
4.Voting Classifier Algorithm: Combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.

4. Deployment using Django
The system is deployed using Django, a Python-based web framework, allowing for the creation of a robust web application.

Dataset
-The dataset comprises 781 rows of data collected from Kaggle.
-This dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning models for diabetes prediction.

Usage
--Ensure all dependencies are installed using Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook.
-Run the Jupyter Notebook file provided to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
-Deploy the system using Django for web-based access.   

web-based access-Usage

1. Input your health parameters into the web interface.
2. Click on the "Submit" button to generate predictions.
3. View the prediction results along with visualization.
4. Customize settings and algorithms as needed.
5. Deploy the system for real-world use.
